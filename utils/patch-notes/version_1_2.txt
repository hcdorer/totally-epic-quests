Totally Epic Quests is back from holiday break, with an amazing gift for all of you!  **Welcome to version 1.2!**
This version introduces many quality-of-life changes for users and mods and introduces a couple of brand-new features as well!

Patch Notes:
+ Added recurring quests.  This is a new type of quest that can be completed by a single member any number of times, granting the same reward each time.  In /quest list or /quest view, the üîÅ emoji denotes a recurring quest.
\- Removed ``/quest accept`` and ``/quest cancel``.
\* Simplified quest turn-in process.  Now, you just need to use ``/quest turn-in <quest-name>``, where ``quest-name`` is the quest you wish to turn in.  This will generate the approval message in your server's mod channel, so the approval step is not skipped.
+ Added autocomplete for the ``name`` fields of ``/quest create``, ``/quest delete``, ``/quest edit``, ``/quest turn-in``, and ``quest view`` (and the ``prerequisite`` field for ``/quest create`` and ``quest edit``).
\* Quest approval messages now use an embed, which also contains the description of the quest in question as a friendly reminder for the mods.
\* ``/config rank-role view`` now generates the rank role list in an embed as well.
+ Added a safeguard against accidentally resetting server progress using ``/init``.  TEQ will now ask you if you are sure, giving you the option to cancel the action.
+ TEQ can now display its patch notes in each server's message channel.
